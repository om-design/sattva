## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Critical Validation ✅

**Your question:** "Does roadmap preserve attractor wells and structural self-regulation?"

**My original roadmap:** ❌ Had critical gaps
- Used FAISS nearest neighbor (not basin dynamics)
- Used normalization (not structural regulation)  
- Used connections (not geometric resonance)

**Corrected roadmap:** ✅ Now preserves theory
- Gradient descent into basins
- Geometric competition + energy + inhibition + homeostasis
- Similarity-based field resonance

**Document:** `architecture/VALIDATION_theory_to_implementation.md`

### 2. Complete Theory Review ✅

**Read entire SATTVA repository:**
- All theory/*.md files
- All experiments/*.py files  
- All src/sattva/*.py files

**Confirmed:**
- SATTVA acronym: Semantic Attractor Training of Transforming Vector Associations
- Geometric multiplexing is core innovation
- Experiments validate theory
- Implementation approach is sound

### 3. Developmental Training Protocol ✅

**Established stage-gated learning:**

```
Stage 0: Secured substrate (refractory protection)
  ↓ 10k physical experiences
Stage 1: Physics foundation (unambiguous truths)
  ↓ BIAS validation, peer consensus
Stage 2: Language grounding (after physics solid)
  ↓ Test inference, verb-noun pairs
Stage 3: Complex reasoning (GATED until ready)
```

**Key insights:**
- Can't skip stages (explicit gates)
- Slow formation (refractory period)
- Need 10× signal to override active connection
- Trauma-informed deep encoding

### 4. Checkpoint Mechanism Created ✅

**Purpose:** Trap current thinking to prevent drift

**Files created:**
- `theory/CHECKPOINT_001_landing_20260109.md` - Full state capture
- `theory/SESSION_SUMMARY_20260109.md` - This file

**Usage:**
- Compare future thinking to checkpoint
- If matches old rejected approach → WRONG TRACK
- If diverges with reason → PROGRESS
- If diverges without reason → DRIFT (investigate)

### 5. Three New Explorations ✅

**A. Geometric Algebra**
- File: `theory/geometric_algebra_exploration.md`
- Question: Better mathematical foundation?
- Status: TO EXPLORE (3-week experiment)
- Potential: Elegant rotation handling, natural geometry

**B. String Collapse Mechanism**
- File: `theory/string_collapse_mechanism.md`
- Concept: False primitive "house of cards" collapse
- Status: FORMALIZED
- Implementation: Integrated with peer validation

**C. Periodic Peer Validation**
- File: `theory/periodic_peer_validation_protocol.md`
- Concept: Batch learning with consensus check-ins
- Status: FORMALIZED
- Frequency: 30 min (physics) → 2 hours (reasoning)

### 6. Architecture Documents Created ✅

**Files:**
1. `architecture/implementation_roadmap.md` - 12-month plan to production
2. `architecture/QUICKSTART.md` - 3 paths to start (A/B/C)
3. `architecture/VALIDATION_theory_to_implementation.md` - Critical corrections

**Status:** All reviewed and validated against theory

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Commitments

✅ **3D spatial substrate** (not 4D+)  
✅ **Depth as coupling range** (0.2 surface → 0.9 deep = 10× broadcast)  
✅ **Time as context modulation** (not spatial dimension)  
✅ **Basin dynamics** (gradient descent, not nearest neighbor)  
✅ **Structural regulation** (competition + energy + inhibition + homeostasis)  
✅ **Geometric resonance** (similarity-based, not connection-based)  

### Training Commitments

✅ **Developmental stages** (physics → language → reasoning)  
✅ **Slow formation** (refractory protection, formation_rate=0.01)  
✅ **Peer validation** (5 agents, 80% consensus)  
✅ **BIAS integration** (anomaly detection, flip mechanism)  
✅ **Gated capabilities** (can't skip stages, prerequisites enforced)  
✅ **Batch learning** (100-500 experiences, periodic validation)  

### Technology Commitments

✅ **Rust core** (performance-critical: substrate, dynamics, regulation)  
✅ **Python bindings** (flexibility: primitives, language, training)  
✅ **FAISS** (initialization only, not primary mechanism)  
✅ **MuJoCo** (physical grounding simulation)  
✅ **gRPC** (peer network communication)  
✅ **12-month roadmap** (5 phases to production)  

### Rejections

❌ Traditional clustering (k-means, etc.)  
❌ Explicit connection weights  
❌ External normalization  
❌ Pre-loaded facts  
❌ Token prediction paradigm  
❌ 4D+ spatial dimensions  
❌ Corpus training without grounding  
❌ Skipping developmental stages

## Core Insights Captured

### 1. Geometric Multiplexing

**The innovation:**
- Same physical connections serve infinite meanings
- Context selects which geometric clusters resonate
- One neuron belongs to 1000+ clusters
- Each cluster combination = different meaning

**Scaling advantage:**
- Traditional: O(F × N²) connections
- SATTVA: O(N) connections serving infinite functions
- ~250× more efficient

### 2. Attractor Wells ≠ Clustering

**Not:** Nearest neighbor search  
**Yes:** Gradient descent into basins

**Why critical:**
- Patterns FLOW along force gradients
- Multiple forces compete/cooperate
- Natural noise resistance
- Overlapping basins (ambiguity)

### 3. Structural Regulation ≠ Normalization

**Not:** External scaling to constant  
**Yes:** Emergent from geometry

**Four mechanisms:**
1. Basin competition (stronger suppress weaker)
2. Energy constraints (can't activate everything)
3. Local inhibition (active regions suppress neighbors)
4. Homeostatic equilibrium (seeks balance)

### 4. Two-Timescale Dynamics

**Slow (hours-days):** Pattern formation, connection changes  
**Fast (milliseconds):** Pattern activation, resonance

**Why safe:**
- Formation is rate-limited (prevents runaway during learning)
- Fast operation over stable substrate (validated patterns)
- Separation breaks positive feedback loop

### 5. Trauma-Informed Architecture

**Deep encoding when overloaded:**
- Depth = 0.9 (vs 0.2 normal)
- Broadcast range = 50.0 (vs 5.0 normal)
- Fractal structure (self-similar levels)
- Requires 10× signal to override

**Why hard to change yet brittle:**
- Deep = affects everything (wide influence)
- Protected = needs strong signal
- But: Single strong counter-evidence can break support string
- Then: Cascade collapse (house of cards)

### 6. String Collapse (House of Cards)

**False primitive = load-bearing card:**
- Supported by "string" of validating experiences
- Isolated from counter-evidence
- Feels unshakeable
- Actually brittle

**Single break:**
- Counter-evidence breaks support string
- Critical mass of breaks → collapse
- Cascade to dependent primitives
- Total structure falls

**Why brainwashing fails:**
- Only held by isolation
- External input breaks isolation
- Entire conditioning collapses at once

### 7. Time as Context (Not Dimension)

**Not:** 4th spatial dimension  
**Yes:** Contextual modulation of 3D space

**Example:**
```
Position: [0.5, 0.3, 0.7] (3D spatial)
Morning context → "breakfast" associations
Evening context → "dinner" associations

Same space, different time, different meaning
```

## Open Questions (Next Checkpoint)

### 1. Geometric Algebra

**Question:** Does GA provide better mathematical foundation?  
**Timeline:** 3-week proof of concept  
**Status:** Experimental track (non-blocking)  
**Decision:** Based on simplicity + performance + team understanding  

### 2. Scaling Validation

**Question:** How does substrate scale to 1M+ units?  
**Concerns:** Field computation, memory, performance  
**Status:** Needs benchmarking in Phase 1  
**Target:** <5ms similarity search, <20ms field computation  

### 3. Optimal Peer Configuration

**Question:** Best agent mix for each stage?  
**Current:** 5 agents (specialists + generalists)  
**Status:** Needs empirical tuning  
**Metrics:** Consensus stability, detection rate, false positive rate
