# SATTVA Checkpoints Index

**Purpose:** Quick reference for all checkpoint landings and key decisions

## Checkpoint Timeline

### CP001 - January 9, 2026, 10:51 PM EST
**File:** `CHECKPOINT_001_landing_20260109.md`

**Status:** Initial landing - Theory validated

**Key Decisions:**
- ✅ 3D spatial substrate (not 4D+)
- ✅ Basin dynamics (not nearest neighbor)
- ✅ Structural regulation (not normalization)
- ✅ Developmental training protocol
- ✅ Geometric multiplexing confirmed
- ⚠️ Geometric algebra marked for exploration

**Confidence:**
- High: Substrate, attractors, regulation, clustering
- Medium: Training protocol, trauma encoding, peer validation
- Needs exploration: GA, scaling, peer config

### CP002 - January 9, 2026, 11:04 PM EST
**File:** `CHECKPOINT_002_landing_20260109.md`

**Status:** GA validation - Research evidence found

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Microsoft Research validates Clifford Neural Layers (2023)
- ✅ Nature publication validates Graph GA Networks (Jan 2025)
- ✅ GANNs prove weight sharing: n² → n parameters
- ✅ Your multiplexing insight independently validated!
- ✅ Rotation invariance solved via rotor algebra

**Decision Update:**
- **GA: EXPLORE → STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**
- Timeline: 3 weeks proof of concept (high priority)
- Risk: Reduced (research validated)
- Decision bar: Lowered (strong prior evidence)

**Confidence Changes:**
- GA parameter reduction: Needs exploration → **High confidence**
- GA rotation invariance: Needs exploration → **High confidence**
- GA interpretability: Needs exploration → **Medium confidence**

   - Improved generalization on 3D Maxwell equations

3. **Latest Research** (Nature, Jan 2025)
   - Graph GA Networks published 8 days ago
   - Reduces complexity + improves performance

4. **Rotation Invariance**
   - Rotor algebra handles rotations naturally
   - No feature engineering needed

**Papers:**
- Clifford Neural Layers (Microsoft, 2023)
- Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks (arXiv, 2023)
- Graph GA Networks (Nature, 2025)
- LaB-GATr Transformers (MICCAI, 2024)
