# Bad Primitive Correction Protocol Experiment

## Overview

This experiment validates the trauma-informed correction mechanisms extracted from personal healing experience. It demonstrates how a system with developmental architecture can:

1. **Encode harmful "bad primitives" during formation**
2. **Detect patterns the substrate can't see** (external observer)
3. **Accumulate evidence and flip belief** (threshold mechanism)
4. **Trigger cascade collapse** (rapid restructuring)
5. **Recover to healthy state**

## Theoretical Foundation

See `theory/trauma_informed_architecture.md` for complete analysis of:
- How abuse encodes false primitives during development
- Why substrate examining itself can't detect the pattern
- Three correction mechanisms that actually work
- Computational principles for AI safety

## Experiment Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Healthy System
- Create substrate with 1000 units
- Bootstrap 20 "healthy" primitives (depth ~0.6)
- System functions normally

### Phase 2: Encode Bad Primitive
- Simulate "early trauma" by encoding primitive with depth=0.95
- Located at center of space (high connectivity)
- Represents "I am unwanted" or similar foundational false belief

### Phase 3: Demonstrate Disproportionate Influence
- Weakly activate bad primitive
- Show it broadcasts widely (deep encoding → large influence range)
- Corrupts many downstream processes
- Measure: units influenced, energy, activation spread

### Phase 4: External Observer Detection
- Observer watches behavioral patterns (actions, not thoughts)
- Detects repeated self-sabotage
- Infers underlying primitive
- **Key:** Observer can see what substrate can't (not using same lens)

### Phase 5: Threshold Flip Mechanism
- Log anomalies: observations that don't fit primitive
- Detect conflicts of interest: who encoded this?
- Add counter-evidence from external sources
- Track confidence: mainstream vs. counter-narrative
- When threshold crossed (60%): **FLIP**
- Old narrative becomes hypothesis being tested

### Phase 6: Cascade Collapse
- Apply strong external counter-evidence
- Hits foundational primitive
- Triggers cascade: dependent beliefs lose support
- Rapid restructuring (like "breakthrough" moment)
- Measure: how many primitives affected

### Phase 7: Measure Recovery
- Re-run dynamics with corrected primitives
- Bad primitive now has reduced depth
- Measure: influence reduction, energy reduction
- Validate system stability

### Phase 8: Visualization
- Energy trajectories (before/after)
- Active units (before/after)
- Threshold flip confidence over time
- Primitive depth distributions

## Running the Experiment

```bash
cd experiments/bad_primitive_correction
python test_correction_protocol.py
```

## Expected Results

**Before correction:**
- Bad primitive (depth=0.95) influences 200-300 units (20-30%)
- High system energy
- Widespread activation cascade

**After correction:**
- Bad primitive depth reduced to ~0.09
- Influence reduced by 50-80%
- System energy reduced
- Stable dynamics restored

**Threshold flip:**
- Confidence in bad primitive decreases with each anomaly
- Conflict detection triggers 180° reversal (halves confidence)
- Counter-evidence accumulates
- Flip occurs when counter > 0.6

**Cascade collapse:**
- Strong external evidence reduces foundation to <0.2
- Dependent primitives lose support
- Recursive collapse through dependency graph
- 3-10 primitives typically affected

## Key Insights Validated

### 1. Invisible Primitives
✓ Substrate examining itself can't detect bad primitive  
✓ External observer required  
✓ Pattern visible in actions, not accessible to introspection

### 2. Disproportionate Influence
✓ Deep encoding (high depth) → wide broadcast range  
✓ Single bad primitive corrupts many processes  
✓ Effect scales with depth value

### 3. Threshold Flip Works
✓ Anomaly accumulation reduces confidence systematically  
✓ Conflict detection triggers presumption reversal  
✓ Flip is earned, not forced  
✓ Old narrative becomes testable hypothesis

### 4. Cascade Collapse
✓ Strong external counter-evidence can hit foundation  
✓ Single crack triggers cascade through dependencies  
✓ Explains sudden "breakthrough" moments  
✓ System remains stable during collapse

### 5. Load-Bearing Structure
✓ Can't just delete (would leave holes)  
✓ Gradual depth reduction preserves stability  
✓ System functions during correction  
✓ Recovery is measurable

## Theoretical Links

**Personal healing → Computational principles:**

| Healing Mechanism | Implementation | Validation |
|------------------|----------------|------------|
| External witness (seeing grandmother abuse others) | `ExternalObserver.observe_behavior()` | Detects patterns in actions |
| Threshold flip (BIAS tool, Mae Brussel) | `ThresholdFlip` with 180° reversal | Accumulates evidence, flips at threshold |
| Cascade collapse (brainwashing resistance) | `CascadeCollapse.trigger_cascade()` | Hits foundation, cascades through dependencies |
| Nature grounding | External field coupling (future work) | Stable reference for regulation |
| Meditation loosening | Temporary coupling reduction (future work) | Present-moment bypass of primitives |

## Clinical Parallels

**Therapy session = External observer**  
Therapist sees patterns you can't see (different substrate)

**Multiple sessions = Threshold building**  
Counter-evidence accumulates over time

**Breakthrough moment = Cascade collapse**  
"I suddenly saw it all differently"

**Gradual improvement = Depth annealing**  
Bad primitive loses influence slowly over time

## AI Safety Implications

**This experiment validates critical safety properties:**

1. **Detection:** External monitoring can identify harmful primitives
2. **Correction:** Systematic evidence accumulation enables safe correction
3. **Stability:** System remains functional during correction
4. **Verification:** Recovery is measurable and verifiable
5. **Architecture:** Developmental systems need correction mechanisms

**For AI systems with developmental architecture:**
- Monitor for "bad primitives" encoded during training
- Implement external observer modules
- Support threshold-based correction protocols
- Design for cascade resilience
- Measure correction effectiveness

## Future Extensions

1. **Multiple bad primitives** - How do they interact?
2. **Partial correction** - What if flip doesn't complete?
3. **Reactivation** - Can corrected primitive re-encode?
4. **External field grounding** - Nature simulation
5. **Meditative loosening** - Temporary coupling reduction
6. **Multi-perspective analysis** - Understanding source context
7. **Reconsolidation windows** - Optimal correction timing

**This experiment demonstrates that personal healing insights translate directly to computational architecture principles. The mechanisms that help humans recover from trauma can inform how we build AI systems that can recognize and correct their own foundational errors.**
