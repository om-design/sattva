# GA Expert Intuition Experiment

This experiment validates the GA-SATTVA core by:

- Creating a small expert library of GA primitives (patterns as multivectors).
- Partially cueing one primitive and running baseline dynamics.
- Increasing GA coupling (stress) and observing resonance behavior.
- Returning to baseline (recovery) and checking restoration.

All logic is built on `src/sattva/ga_sattva_core.py`.
