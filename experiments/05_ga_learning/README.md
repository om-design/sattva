# GA Learning Experiment

This experiment tests whether the GA-SATTVA core can exhibit learning:

- Repeated exposure to a "training" pattern updates its GA primitive.
- After training, weak or noisy cues favor the trained primitive.
- Regulation properties (no runaway, recovery) remain intact.

All logic is built on `src/sattva/ga_sattva_core.py`.
